### Annika McPeek
## Software Developer - App Academy Grad - JavaScript | Python | React | Redux | Node.js | Express.js | PostgreSQL | Flask | HTML5 | CSS - Ed Tech Implementation Leader  - STEM Education Leader

My two passions have always been to build solutions that help others and teach others the skills needed to become the next generation of creators and users of technology. 

This led me to become a STEM educator and leader. More recently joining an education tech startup allowed me to scale my impact. The solutions I was creating were now able to help students across the country. 

I decided I want to increase my impact by becoming a software engineer and building solutions in a new way. At App Academy become a full stack developer creating an Asana clone using a Python, Flask, and SqlAchemy backend and Java Script React frontend. I participated in a group project cloning Kick starter with the same stack. I also created an Airbnb clone with a Java Script, Express, and Sequelize backend. 

I am looking for a new role to continue developing my skills as a software engineer.
